print('Long ago, the world was covered in a great machine ruled by a single computer, ignorant of the humans surviving within it.')
print('One day, the computer spontaniously failed, throwing this metal world into chaos and dissarray and threatening the surviving cities.')
print('A century later, humans, who longed for peace, decided they would journey to their mechanical ruler, attempting to revive him.')
print("But, by the time they reached him, they learned of the world that existed before the great machine and of the machine's warlike purpose.")
print('They decided instead that they would let the machine rot and crumble so that the world could return to its natural state.')
